module Pledge
  # Limit access to the file system using unveil(2).  +paths+ should be a hash
  # where keys are paths and values are the access permissions for that path.  Each
  # value should be a string with the following characters specifying what
  # permissions are allowed:
  #
  # r :: Allow read access to existing files and directories
  # w :: Allow write access to existing files and directories
  # c :: Allow create/delete access for new files and directories
  # x :: Allow execute access to programs
  #
  # You can use the empty string as permissions if you want to allow no access
  # to the given path, even if you have granted some access to a folder above
  # the given folder.  You can use a value of +:gem+ to allow read access to
  # the directory for the gem specified by the key.
  #
  # If called with an empty hash, adds an unveil of +/+ with no permissions,
  # which denies all access to the file system if +unveil_without_lock+
  # was not called previously.
